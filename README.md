# A Mathematical Notation Template

I got tired of forgetting which Latin and Greek letters I've already used in a paper.
Going through the Greek letters in my head, trying to remember if there were any I've forgotten and which ones I've used, and which ones look the same as Latin letters.
Did I use $N$ or $n$ for the number of observations?

So, I made this template. It's like an API spec for mathematical notation.
More accurately, this is a template for the "Notation" section that is occurs in books, but that doesn't sound as trendy.

If you, lost soul, have come across this, I pity you.
Perhaps you will find this of use. Or even better, you will alert me to a more efficient way of accomplishing this objective.

Anyways, see [notation.md](notation.md) for the template.
